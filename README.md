HashString.java will generate a hash value for a text input or a file to be read. A test file is provided but it should work with any text file. It will return a string of the text that is hashed along side returning a string of the hash value
that it generates. 
The encrypt/decrypt uses a Caesar Cipher that allows you to choose the shift and needs text provided as the input variable and will encrypt the message. It then gives the user the encrypted string. It then allows the user
to decrypt the message and presenting them with the string of the deciphered message. 
The word document presents the sign/verify process using openssl. Generating private and public keys, then signing the file with the private key, and then verifying that the file was signed by the private key with the public key.
